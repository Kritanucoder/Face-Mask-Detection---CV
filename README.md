# Project-12---Face-Mask-Detection---CV
This project presents a deep learning-based face mask detection system using the EfficientNetB3 architecture. Leveraging annotated datasets with XML-based bounding boxes, the system automatically detects and classifies face regions into three categories: “with_mask,” “without_mask,” and “mask_weared_incorrect.” Each face is extracted from the original image using parsed annotations, resized, and preprocessed before being used for training. EfficientNetB3, known for its balance between accuracy and efficiency, is used as the backbone model, fine-tuned with a custom classification head. The dataset is split for training and validation, and augmented using various transformations to improve generalization. The trained model is evaluated using classification metrics and confusion matrices. Additionally, a real-time prediction module allows testing on individual images. This approach delivers a scalable, high-accuracy solution suitable for surveillance systems or public health compliance monitoring.
